# Face detection _(work in progress)_
full project title: _Face Detection using Tensors* and Keypoints**_  
*Tensor = _n_-dimmenisonal array
**Keypoints = interest points in images

## Objectives
- understand tensor operations and practical tensor applications
- understand various keypoint detection algorithms ([SIFT](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/da/df5/tutorial_py_sift_intro.html), [FAST](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/df/d0c/tutorial_py_fast.html), [ORB](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d1/d89/tutorial_py_orb.html))
- using keypoints in face detection applications

## Steps
- generate a tensor from a file-system face database 
- compute image keypoints 
- automatically identify new face images and add them to the face database accordingly
